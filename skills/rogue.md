The Rogue tree focuses on speed and mobility. Sustaining in this tree in solo play is a bit more difficult than the [Warrior](/skills/warrior) Tree, but there are some interesting buffs and combos at play. Agile focuses primarily on the speed of daggers and the Power stat.

## Tier 1

#### **Dagger Mastery**

Passively increases damage dealt with daggers. Stacks with Weapon Knowledge.

#### **Ransack**

Burst forward. Damages enemies and steals a small amount of flips. Ransack is a fan favorite to splash for all trees.

#### **Cruelty**

Critical hits gradually heal HP over time. Getting a second critical hit while the regeneration is active refreshes the timer. This stacks with Regenerate, but does not stack with items that give regenerative effects, such as [Hot Tea](items/hot-tea).

## Tier 2

#### **Stealth**

Prevents enemies from seeing or damaging the player for a brief time. Attacking or getting hurt by some other obstacle cancels the buff early.

#### **Backstab**

Quickly stab, dealing massive damage to enemies if hit from behind

#### **Crit Mastery**

Breaking stealth temporarily boosts critical hit rate.

## Tier 3

#### **Enchant Poison**

Temporarily increases damage and gives basic attacks a chance to poison enemies.

#### **Rapid Strike**

Rapidly attack the area in front of the player.

#### **Adrenaline**

Briefly boosts [attack speed](/stats/aspd) after Backstabbing an enemy.

## Tier 4

#### **Fortune**

Temporarily increases [money](/currency/flips) drop rate for all nearby players.Â 

#### **Greed**

Increases [money](/currency/flips) pickup radius substantially.

#### **Coin Toss**

Throw [money](/currency/flips) at the enemies, dealing massive damage.
