<p>Multiplayer in Heroes of Umbra is played over a network. There are two methods of playing with friends: Game Server (default) and IP Address (advanced). Modes can be configured in the game settings.</p>
<h1>Game Server (Default)</h1>
<p>Selecting a previously-created character gives you the option of <strong>Starting</strong> or <strong>Joining</strong> a game</p>
<h3>Starting a Server</h3>
<p>Start Game creates a private game server. Upon successfully starting the game, you'll be given a 4-letter code. To invite friends, share the 4-letter code and have them select Join Game, entering the 4-letter code.</p>
<p>You may also share the server with the <a href="http://discord.heroesofumbra.com">Alcuria Games discord</a> by typing the <code>/share</code> command in-game along with an optional message.</p>
<p>Shared game progress (switches pressed, bosses defeated) is not saved between games. Please avoid repeatedly creating games within a short period of time, otherwise you won't be able to create or join games for a bit.</p>
<h3>Joining a Game</h3>
<p>Ensure your connection mode is <strong>Game Server</strong> (this is the default setting) and from the character select screen, choose <strong>Join Game</strong>. Enter the provided 4-letter code and have fun!</p>
<h1>IP Address</h1>
<h3>Local Multiplayer</h3>
<p>If you are playing with friends and you are all on the same network, simply note the local (or internal) IP displayed when the game begins and have your friends enter that IP under the "Join Game" section of the character select screen.</p>
<p>Note: The game will display the internal IP from the first network adapter it finds, which is usually but not always the correct IP. If it is not, you can find out the IP by using <strong>Windows + R &gt; "cmd" &gt; "ipconfig"</strong> and searching for an active IPv4 address there.</p>
<h3>Online Multiplayer</h3>
<p>To invite friends over the internet, you'll need to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/244314/how_to_forward_ports_on_your_router.html">forward the required port</a> (TCP and port 24234 by default). If you have a firewall, you'll also need to ensure an exception is made for the corresponding port. Then, give friends your <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/">public IP</a>. Your public/external IP is not displayed in-game.</p>
<p>To change the port, edit it within the in-game Options. Note, this port is used for hosting <i>and</i> connecting to games.</p>
<h4>Dedicated Servers</h4>
<p>You can host your own dedicated servers by running the included <strong>heroes-of-umbra.jar</strong> file! Just run the following command from command-line:</p>
<p><strong>java -jar heroes-of-umbra.jar server slot=&lt;slot&gt;</strong></p>
<p>Where &lt;slot&gt; is a number corresponding to the character slot you want to load for the purposes of game progress.</p>
<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>If you are unable to connect to a server, here are a few common solutions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the ports match. If you're trying to connect to a server on a custom port, the default settings are insufficient.</li>
  <li>Ensure your firewall is not blocking either outbound (for joining) or inbound (for hosting) connections from the configured port (default 24234). An easy way to rule if your firewall is the culprit behind connection issues is to simply temporarily disable it and see if you are able to connect.</li>
  <li>Ensure you're running the same version of the game as the host.</li>
  <li>Ensure you've typed the IP correctly.&nbsp;;)</li>
  <li>If you're still unable to get things working, shoot an email to <strong>support@alcuria.net</strong> with steps you've tried, any relevant error messages, and so on.</li>
</ol>
