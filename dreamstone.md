Dreamstone (stylized as dreamstone) is a service which allows synchronizing game data across multiple devices (desktop and mobile).

# Before you Begin
The dreamstone service costs -/year. There is a one-month trial. (I appreciate your support!) 

If you choose to use this service, you must have an internet connection to retrieve and save character data. The game will warn you if there is an issue saving.

# Getting Started
1. Register on [dreamstone.alcuria.net](https://dreamstone.alcuria.net/).
2. Copy your user id (treat it like a password).
3. Launch HoU
	a. Select the dreamstone icon by pressing right on the title screen.
  b. Press confirm to sync game data.
  
# How does this work?
When you sync game data to dreamstone, your data will no longer be saved locally. Instead, it is stored in a database on dreamstone.

# How do I stop using the service?
* To cancel your subscription, visit the [Subscription Benefits Page](https://dreamstone.alcuria.net/subscriptions/complete) and press the **Manage Subscription** button. Enter your email to get a link to manage your subscription.
* To download your character data, use the `/pull` chat command.
