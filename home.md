# Storyline 
Once a fabled assassin, you hunted those who jeopardized the order and balance of your home village. Now, after a blinding flash of light during a routine mission to stop a murderer who calls himself The Apprentice, you find yourself alone on a mysterious island with little recollection of the task at hand. Can you recall and complete your original mission and stop this mysterious killer before he reaches his target?
