# Modifiers
Mastery modifiers refer to a collection of attributes associated with weapons and abilities when calculating damage rates.

## Speed Modifier
The Speed Modifier describes how fast weapons will be. More specifically, it dictates how effective Attack Speed is as a stat with a particular weapon type. The max Attack Speed at 0% Speed Modifier is 300. With a Speed Modifier of +10%, you would only need 272 Attack Speed (300 / 1.1) to reach the fastest attack speed in the game. In other words, a player with 300 Attack Speed, 0% Speed Modifier, attacks at the same speed as a player with 272 Attack Speed with the +10% Speed Modifier. Heavier weapons, such as Axes, will require more Attack Speed to reach the speed cap, but in exchange do much more damage (see swing/stab modifier tables).

## Mastery Modifier
Mastery modifier is a flat percentage added to skill damage. For instance, with 30% Mastery Modifier and a skill that does 300% damage, that skill would now deal 330% damage.

## Stab Modifier/Swing Modifier
Flat percentage damage added to stabs and swings respectively.
