Mystery equipment is intended to be the final grade of equipment. There are currently three tiers which unlock at various Orb Ranks.

# Primary and Secondary Attributes
Equipment generated has one or more primary and secondary attributes.

|Type|Primary|Secondary|
|-|-|-|
|Sword|Atk|Def, Mdef, Crit, Aspd, Cspd|
|Armor|Def|Atk, Matk, Mdef, Crit, Aspd, Hp%|

The base primary attribute is the main roll on the equipment. For sword, the primary attribute (attack) is 80 and a secondary attribute is 15.

A tier attribute boosts the primary and secondary attribute by 0, 15, and 30 (?). Equip boosters can further increase the primary attribute by 50%.

Claws and daggers get two secondaries, to compensate for much lower primary attributes, and are guaranteed to get 20 additional aspd.

Once the primary and secondary attribute(s) are decided, a random value is chosen between that attribute and double its value.

Some types (accessories) add skill ranks. The skills chosen are based on the tree with the most points.
