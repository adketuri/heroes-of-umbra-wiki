## Getting The Game
The game is available to purchase on the [Heroes of Umbra Steam Page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/645380/Heroes_of_Umbra/) for Windows. Additional operating systems and distribution platforms to come.

## Basic Controls
* Arrow Keys: Move player/cursor
* Enter: Confirm
* Escape: Menu
* X: Attack
* Z: Jump/Cancel
* Shift, L.Ctrl, L.Alt, Space, 1, 2: Skill slots
* Q: World Map
* W/A/S/D: Move World Map/Minimap
Note: You'll probably want to remap these in the "Options" screen.

## Customization
From the Options screen you can re-map the keyboard and joystick controls. Other options for enabling fullscreen, adjusting volume, language, and so on are available.

## Creating a Character
From the "Play" menu you are taken to a character select screen. You can choose an existing character or create a new one if you haven't. When creating a character, select a desired name, gender, style, and so on. Beating the game once unlocks more character slots and customization options.

## Starting Vs Joining Games
When you "Start" a game, you start a local server. Players may "Join" your server either with a 4-digit server code (default) or with an IP Address. Refer to the [Multiplayer](/multiplayer) page for details on playing with friends. Playing online with friends is optional, but encouraged.

## Game Flow
After the starting cutscene, you take control of your character. The general flow of the game involves killing enemies, leveling up, and getting strong enough to advance through the game's major dungeons. As you level, you earn Stat Points and Skill Points. Allocating those effectively is key to strengthening your character. If you make a mistake, [Reset Potions](/items/reset-potion) are available to re-allocate Skills+Stats.

## Tips
* Early on it's best to focus on a single skill tree, to unlock higher tiers of skills sooner. Higher tiers of skills generally synergize with or are more powerful than lower-tiered skills.
* Red damage numbers are power-based, Blue numbers are wisdom-based. Stick to one or the other and pump stats accordingly. (M.Atk+Wisdom for magic, Atk+Power for physical.)
* Stamina will greatly help with survivability, but it's a tradeoff between damage output. a 2:1 ratio of your primary stat (Power or Wisdom) to Stamina is recommended, but tweak as needed for more damage or more sustain.

## Saving Progress
Character progress (stats, skills, items, etc) is automatically saved as you play. Progress throughout the game is determined by the host of the game you're playing in.
